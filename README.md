-Screenshot(s) of your app. This makes your app description much easier to understand.-


-A summary section. This should have a concise explanation of what your app does. Try to frame this from the standpoint of what the user does, or what the app enables for the user.-
   
   This app allows users to select a ski resort and number of days to forecast (max of 7 days), and returns information important to ski conditions.  Also returned is a humorous gif which relates to the current snow conditions.
   
   IMPORTANT NOTE - this version is in beta and only allows the user to select one resort, which is Pal in Andorra.  If this app were to go live, many more resorts would be available.


-A section on the technology used. For your capstone, this is fairly simple (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery) but it's still good to list out the key technologies.-
    
    Technologies Used:
        HTML
